    <p>On any given day you may find Chunky and Tick up to their usual mischieveous selfs. Sometimes they
        are dumping shampoo all over the floor so mom will slip. Other times they are hiding dad's headphones
        so he can't listen to his favorite show. Mostly, they are just making sure everyone around knows there
        is no such thing as a <strong>calm child.</strong></p>
